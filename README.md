# Climate change according to Global-Historical-Climatology-Network dataset
Earth is warming up; there are a lot of studies that report temperature rise during last centuries. According to IPCC (The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) global average surface temperature has increased by 0.6 ± 0.2° over the 20th century. In this paper we will try to check out this fact using GHCN (Global Historical Climatology Network) dataset. The GHCN-Monthly is a temperature dataset that contains monthly mean temperatures and is used for operational climate monitoring activities.
